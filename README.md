# AnalysingTransactions
The source code analyzes a set of bank transactions expressed in cents and converts them to dollars. Below are the main stages of transaction analysis:

Displaying transactions (cents and dollars): At the beginning of the program, it displays a set of transactions in cents and converts them to dollars, making it easier to understand their values.

Sorting transactions: Transactions are sorted in ascending order, making it easier to analyze and identify the largest deposits and withdrawals.

Classification of transactions: Transactions are classified into two categories: deposits and withdrawals (if the value is negative). Separate lists are created for both categories.

Converting withdrawals to positive values: Withdrawal values are converted to their absolute values to facilitate analysis and isolate the largest withdrawals.

Displaying the largest withdrawals: The program displays the five largest withdrawals, which can be useful for identifying significant expenses.

Calculating averages: The average values of deposits and withdrawals are calculated, rounded to whole numbers, to understand the typical transaction value.

Calculating the account balance: The program calculates and displays the current account balance after all transactions.

Calculating the number of transactions: The number of transactions in the dataset is determined.

Calculating the account balance after each transaction: The program tracks changes in the account balance after each transaction, allowing for monitoring of how the balance has evolved over time.

This project can be useful for analyzing personal finances or transaction data. You can customize the code to your own needs and use it to analyze various sets of bank transactions.
